# Clear Sky SaaS Platform

**NTUA ECE SAAS 2025 – Team 12**

---

## Project Overview

Clear Sky is a modular, production-grade SaaS platform for academic institutions, designed to manage student grades, review workflows, user authentication, institutional credits, and more. The system is architected as a set of loosely coupled microservices, communicating asynchronously via RabbitMQ, and is fully containerized for easy deployment and scalability.

This project was developed following a formal Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and is accompanied by comprehensive UML documentation (Visual Paradigm Project, VPP), ensuring maintainability, clarity, and extensibility.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure login (classic & Google OAuth2), JWT-based session management, and role-based access control.
- **Grade Management:** Instructors can upload grades via Excel; students can view personal grades and statistics.
- **Review Workflow:** Students submit grade review requests; instructors reply and manage review status.
- **Institutional Credits:** Institutions manage and purchase credits for grade submissions.
- **Statistics & Analytics:** Dynamic grade histograms and performance analytics for courses.
- **Admin & Registration:** Institution onboarding and user management.
- **Modern Web UI:** Responsive front-end with role-based dashboards.

---

## Architecture

The platform is composed of the following microservices:

- **Orchestrator:** API gateway and message router (Go, Gin)
- **User Management Service:** Registration, login, JWT, user roles (Go)
- **Google Auth Service:** Google OAuth2 login, JWT issuance (Go)
- **Credits Service:** Institution credits management (Go, PostgreSQL)
- **Registration Service:** Institution onboarding (Go, PostgreSQL)
- **Initial/Final Grades Services:** Grade import from Excel (Node.js, MongoDB)
- **Stats Service:** Grade statistics and analytics (Node.js, MySQL)
- **View Grades Service:** Student grade viewing (Node.js, MySQL)
- **Student Request Review Service:** Student review requests (Go, PostgreSQL)
- **Instructor Review Reply Service:** Instructor responses (Go, PostgreSQL)
- **Front-end:** Express/EJS web UI (Node.js)

All services communicate via RabbitMQ (`clearSky.events` exchange). The system is orchestrated using Docker Compose for seamless multi-service deployment.

## Documentation

- **SRS:** The project strictly follows a detailed Software Requirements Specification (SRS) which defines all functional and non-functional requirements.
- **UML & Design:** Full UML diagrams (class, sequence, deployment, etc.) are available in Visual Paradigm Project (VPP) format in the `/architecture` folder.
- **API Contracts:** Each service includes its own README with message formats and endpoint documentation.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Languages:** Go 1.24+, Node.js 18+/20+
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite (for some auth)
- **Messaging:** RabbitMQ (direct exchange)
- **Web:** Express.js, EJS, Gin
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
- **Auth:** JWT, Google OAuth2
- **Testing & Tooling:** Visual Paradigm (UML), Postman, npm, go modules

## How to Run

Be sure that the necessary ports are free.
For google auth, you need to set yourself the .env.

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose v2+**
- (Optional for local development) **Go 1.24+** and **Node.js 18+**

### 2. Configuration

- Each microservice requires its own `.env` file.  
  Copy `.env.example` or create a `.env` in each service directory.
- Set environment variables for database connections, RabbitMQ, Google OAuth, and JWT secrets.
- For Google Auth: set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`.

### 3. Build & Launch

```bash
docker compose down -v --remove-orphans
docker compose up --build -d
```

- Check that all containers are running:
  ```bash
  docker compose ps
  ```
- View logs:
  ```bash
  docker compose logs -f
  ```

### 4. Access Points

- **Front-end Web UI:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **Orchestrator API:** [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- **RabbitMQ UI:** [http://localhost:15673](http://localhost:15673) (guest/guest)

### 5. Database Ports

- **PostgreSQL:** 5440–5443 (various services)
- **MySQL:** 3306–3307
- **MongoDB:** 27017–27018

### 6. Stopping & Cleaning

- Stop all services:
  ```bash
  docker compose down
  ```
- Remove all containers, networks, and volumes:
  ```bash
  docker compose down -v --remove-orphans
  ```

---

## Development & Troubleshooting

- Inspect logs for a specific service:
  ```bash
  docker compose logs -f <service>
  ```
- Restart a service after code changes:
  ```bash
  docker compose up --build -d <service>
  ```
- Database access:  
  Use `psql`, `mysql`, or `mongo` CLI tools to connect to the respective DB containers.
- Initial user:
    username: admin
    password: admin
  Then you can create your roles.
  There is only one issue, we havent integrated the role of the Institution Representative into JWT body.

- Common issues:
  - **"relation ... does not exist"**: DB init script did not run. Remove volumes and restart.
  - **Connection refused**: Check service health and correct host/port.
  - **Service restart loops**: Inspect logs for missing environment variables or misconfiguration.

## Why This Project Stands Out

- **Enterprise-Ready:** Clean microservices separation, message-driven, and scalable.
- **Formal Documentation:** SRS and UML artifacts (VPP) for professional maintainability.
- **Full DevOps Pipeline:** Dockerized, with easy local and cloud deployment.
- **Modern Stack:** Uses current best practices in Go, Node.js, and cloud-native design.
- **Portfolio-Grade:** Demonstrates advanced backend, distributed systems, and system design skills.
